    MacOS   => ssh_key = '/Users/'+user+'/.ssh/cisco.key'
    Linux   => ssh_key = '/home/'+user+'/.ssh/cisco.key'        (not yet tested)
    Windows => ssh_key = 'C:\Users\'+user+ '\.ssh\cisco.key'    (not yet tested)
    
General Information:
Application design to propagate configurations over a single/multiple Cisco Routers/Switches

SSH Key Information:
The RSA Key generated by ssh-keygen and then ssh-copy-id won't work, you must install
putty through cli and then use puttygen to regenerate the key. For instance, if the
key is called id_rsa you mus run:

puttygen ~.ssh/id_rsa -O private-openssh -o ~.ssh/new.key

Then point the pkey to the new.key file# gpva
